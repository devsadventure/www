                to rise above what divides us and come together to meet those challenges we can't meet alone. This is where
                we are right now. Because we reject the same thing that people of all faiths reject: the killing of innocent
                men, women, and children. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity,
                opportunity, and a state of their own. I know that for many, the face of globalization is contradictory.
